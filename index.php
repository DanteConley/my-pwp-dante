				Wha, me irresponsible ?! All I wanted you to do was to hand me a screwdriver, Morty! Well I don't like your
				unemployed genes in my grandchildren, Jerry. Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you but what people call
				love is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. A price for everything.
			</p>

			<p>
				You're not gonna believe this, because it usually never happens, but I made a mistake. Nothing to read into
				there! I don't like it here Morty. I can't abide bureaucracy. I don't like being told where to go and what
				to do. I consider it a violation. Did you get those seeds all the way up your butt? Don't even trip about
				your pants, dawg. We got an extra pair right here.
			</p>

			<p>
				There is no god, in your face! One dot muthafucka! You're not gonna believe this, because it usually never
				happens, but I made a mistake. Yo! What up my glip glops! Are you kidding? I'm hoping I can get to both of
				them, Rick!
