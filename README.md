Personal Website Project to display my skills in website development.

## Milestone 1 Feedback

Great job on your Purpose. Very quick and to the point, but it lays out exactly what you want with the site. 
Your Audience and Goal is also done very well - I especially like your focus on easy contact in order for employers or clients to get in contact with you. 

Your Persona is near perfect. Lester fits the idea of a contract for a website very well, and you layed out  his needs and goals in a way that perfectly fits what you learn in the class for your PWP. Great job on this. I also want to give you some extra points for specifying that you're going to build a visual appealing site, but that it needs to be simple. This is usually the case for websites, and I'm glad you already realize that this may be a constant requirement.

Keeping with the near perfect course of your Milestone 1, your Use Case is great. While I've never personally used Craigslist to finds clients, I'm assuming it's a great way to find work. It was a good way of telling me where the client found you. Mentioning that your website contains everything else that Lester will need to contact you and find out about your skills was also done very well.

Last but not least, your directory structure and your HTML is perfect.




### Edits &amp; Suggestions

There were a few things I noticed on your site, as well as some things I want to mention so you can think about it during development.

The first thing I want to mention is some spelling errors in your Persona (hence why I said near perfect. Otherwise, it was literally perfect.) While spelling errors aren't usually a big deal, especially in this class, I wanted to mention it because I don't want to see little mistakes like this on your finished website, or sites you do for clients. Considering you're using your personal site like a resume, this is a lot like mispelling things that you're submitting to employers, and that's not good. Make sure you watch for this in the future.

Second, our guidelines for PWP usually require a single page, and from what I've read here, you have no reason for more than one page. Think about how you're going to incorporate all parts of your site onto one attractive page as you begin development.


Fantastic job overall. You've passed Milestone 1 with Tier IV. Keep up the good work with the next milestones.
