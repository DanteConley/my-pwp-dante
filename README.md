Personal Website Project to display my skills in website development.

## Milestone 1 Feedback

Great job on your Purpose. Very quick and to the point, but it lays out exactly what you want with the site. 
Your Audience and Goal is also done very well - I especially like your focus on easy contact in order for employers or clients to get in contact with you. 

Your Persona is near perfect. Lester fits the idea of a contract for a website very well, and you layed out  his needs and goals in a way that perfectly fits what you learn in the class for your PWP. Great job on this. I also want to give you some extra points for specifying that you're going to build a visual appealing site, but that it needs to be simple. This is usually the case for websites, and I'm glad you already realize that this may be a constant requirement.

Keeping with the near perfect course of your Milestone 1, your Use Case is great. While I've never personally used Craigslist to finds clients, I'm assuming it's a great way to find work. It was a good way of telling me where the client found you. Mentioning that your website contains everything else that Lester will need to contact you and find out about your skills was also done very well.

Last but not least, your directory structure and your HTML is perfect.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions

There were a few things I noticed on your site, as well as some things I want to mention so you can think about it during development.

The first thing I want to mention is some spelling errors in your Persona (hence why I said near perfect. Otherwise, it was literally perfect.) While spelling errors aren't usually a big deal, especially in this class, I wanted to mention it because I don't want to see little mistakes like this on your finished website, or sites you do for clients. Considering you're using your personal site like a resume, this is a lot like mispelling things that you're submitting to employers, and that's not good. Make sure you watch for this in the future.

Second, our guidelines for PWP usually require a single page, and from what I've read here, you have no reason for more than one page. Think about how you're going to incorporate all parts of your site onto one attractive page as you begin development.

Fantastic job overall. You've passed Milestone 1 with Tier IV. Keep up the good work with the next milestones.

## Milestone 2 Feedback

Directory Structure and HTML - Directory structure is still perfect, and you added the needed stuff to your head. Good job on this.

I like the idea presented by your content strategy. You want it to be "simple, but visually appealing," so think about ways to do that properly. You want it to interest people so they don't get bored quickly, but you may need to think of ways to do that with the limited content. I think your idea of a gallery showcasing your art is a great way to keep them interested. Your contact info at the bottom of the page will actually be a contact form that you build and place directly on your site. We'll go over that in class more, but think of ways to implement that into the final design. 

Your desktop wireframe looks good - the division of content in that format looks appealing, and I'm sure with a little extra styling and good color choices, it could look very nice. Your mobile wireframe looks a little messy to me. It looks scrolled over to the right - maybe this was an issue with the wireframe that happened during an export from the site/upload to your pwp? Make sure that the design is set up properly and keep in mind that you'll need to think of a good way to display the image gallery that you want to implement and how you want it to look on a mobile device. Your mobile wireframe also looks like it's missing a lot of the content that the desktop view has. I think it would be beneficial to have the same content for both, just set up differently depending on screen size. 

I would also suggest including a navigation bar at the top, that the user could use to scroll through the page using anchor tags. You could also include links to things such as a downloadable resume, or links to social media. For the Social Media icons, have a look Font Awesome. Very easy to use, simple and straightforward. http://fontawesome.io/

You may want to consider using an image slider to feature pictures of the art. The Bootstrap framework does have an image slider included, but it's not that great. If this is a feature you're interested in having on the site, take a look at the Flickity Slider, the Owl Carosel or Slick. These are only a few of many available slider options out there, and these are mobile/touch friendly.

For custom fonts, I recommend using Google Fonts

Prior to our in-class coverage on the Bootstrap framework, have a look at the Official Bootstrap Documentation and the Deep Dive Bootstrap Material.

When you do begin development, you'll build your page on index.php directly inside your /public_html directory.

### Nice work. Work on your mobile design. Due to the late submission, you are receiving a Tier II grade, but know that you did very well on the overall Milestone 2a guidelines, and I'm excited to see where your design goes.

## Milestone 3 / Final PWP Feedback
Beautiful job on your PWP - your layout looks great on desktop and mobile, and your contact form appears to work perfectly on my end, so check and see if you got my test message. 

You might want to consider using Bootstrap column classes inside your rows to add some additional padding/margin on the mobile view.

Congratulations on a PWP well done. This is a great example of effective execution of a straightforward design concept. Your PWP passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/)
