		<p>
			On this webpage I would like to display different forms of art I have created. The top of the page would be a
			bio, and a picture of me. After that would come a “Sight” section, with pictures of original visual art. After
			the Sight section, would come the “Sound” section, this section would contain a widget linking to my
			SoundCloud. At the bottom of the page will be my contact information so if visitors like what they see they
			can get ahold of me. Overall the page will be pretty simple, but visually appealing.
