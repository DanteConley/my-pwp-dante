		<strong>Persona</strong>
	</header>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Name:</strong>Lester Buchannan</li>
		<li><strong>Age:</strong>early to late 40’s (it’s hard to tell he’s going bald)</li>
		<li><strong>Profession:</strong>: Lester owns a small carpet and curtain cleaning business he is looking for
		someone to spice up his very basic and boring website. I may be a candidate.</li>
		<li><strong>Technology:</strong>2012 17” MacBook Pro, and an older flip phone with no internet access.</li>
		<li><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors:</strong>Lester doesn’t care about bells and whistles, has had the same phone
		for 8 years and aside from having to change out the battery it still works great. And he likes that. His computer
		is older but still works fine as well, so unless something gives out he wont be updating his tech any time soon.</li>
		<li><strong>Frustrations and Needs:</strong>Even though he doesn’t heavily use technology, he is aware that it is
		a very powerful marketing tool and he wants to update his websites information and make it more aesthetically
		pleasing. Right his website hasn’t been updated since its creation 5 years ago. He is looking for somebody to make
		it look more organized and to update the contact information. He doesn’t want to pay to fortune but is still
		]willing to spend a pretty penny if he feels the website is created to his expectations.</li>
		<li><strong>Goals:</strong> Lester is hoping, by visiting my website, to find the right candidate to update his
		business page. He would also like to get an email to go with his domain name so he can drop the @gmail and make
		his business look more professional with an @LestersCleanerCarpets domain. My site needs to be visually appealing
		and straight forward enough that even someone like Lester can easily navigate.</li>
	</ul>

		<strong>Use Case:</strong>
	</header>
	<p>
		I responded to an ad Lester had on Craigslist with an email. Lester reads my resume that I attached to the email
		and decides I could possibly be a good fit for the job. To learn a bit more about me and to see the skills I
		bragged about in my email, he decides to check out my website. Pleased with what he sees he plans to call me
		Monday on a phone number I have listed under the contact information I have on the page.
